                    <strong> Apple threatened to remove Facebook's products from its App Store, after the BBC found
                        domestic "slaves" for sale on
                        apps, including Instagram, in 2019.</strong>
                </p>

                <p> The threat was revealed in the Wall Street Journal's (WSJ) Facebook Files, a series of reports based
                    on its viewing of
                    internal Facebook documents.

                <p> Facebook says it prohibits human exploitation "in no uncertain terms". </p>

                <p> It says it has been "combating human trafficking on our platform for many years". </p>

                <p> The firm added: "Our goal remains to prevent anyone who seeks to exploit others from having a home
                    on
                    our platform." </p>

                </p>

                <h2>Hashtag slavery</h2>
                <p> <span class="important"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IdII_n28e0"> The BBC News Arabic
                            investigation </a></span> exposed a booming online black
                    market in the
                    illegal buying and selling of domestic workers.

                <p> It shed light on a world in which women endured a life of servitude and were kept behind closed
                    doors, deprived of their basic rights, unable to leave and at risk of being sold to the highest
                    bidder. Experts said these conditions amounted to slavery.</p>

                <p> The trade was carried out using a number of apps including Facebook-owned Instagram.</p>

                <p> The posts and hashtags used for sales were mainly in Arabic, and shared by users in Saudi Arabia and
                    Kuwait.</p>

                <p> The women were often categorised by race, and available to buy for a few thousand dollars.</p>

                <p> The WSJ reported that following the BBC investigation, Apple told Facebook to do more to tackle
                    human trafficking.</p>

                <p> It said the social media giant only took "limited action" until "Apple Inc. threatened to remove
                    Facebook's products from the App Store, unless it cracked down on the practice".</p>

                <p> The BBC has approached Apple about the claim. </p>

                <ol class="links">
                    <li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50266663"> Slave markets found on Instagram and
                            other apps </a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50266663">Kuwait moves on Instagram slave traders
                        </a></li>
                </ol>

                <p>The paper also quoted a 2019 internal report from Facebook, suggesting that the social media giant
                    knew about, and had been investigating, the online slave trade before the BBC got in contact.</p>

                <p> In the report, a Facebook researcher writes: "Was this issue known to Facebook before BBC inquiry
                    and Apple escalation?</p>

                <p> "Yes. Throughout 2018 and [the first half of] 2019 we conducted the global Understanding Exercise in
                    order to fully understand how domestic servitude manifests on our platform across its entire life
                    cycle: recruitment, facilitation, and exploitation."</p>

                </video>

                <p> After the 2019 BBC report, Facebook banned the main hashtag used for the trade and removed hundreds
                    of
                    accounts from Instagram.</p>

                <p> "We will continue to work with law enforcement, expert organisations and industry to prevent this
                    behaviour on our platforms," it said in response to the investigation.</p>

                <p> However, at the time the story was published the BBC found women were still advertised for sale on
                    the
                    platform.</p>
